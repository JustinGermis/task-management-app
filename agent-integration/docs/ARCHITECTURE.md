# AI Agent Integration Architecture

## Overview
This integration enables AI agents to interact with the Task Management System using OpenAI's Agents SDK. The architecture is designed to be non-invasive and work alongside the existing app without breaking current functionality.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Task Analysis & Assignment
- **Goal**: Analyze available tasks and assign them to specialized agents
- **Flow**: 
  1. Agent queries available tasks via Edge Function
  2. Analyzes task requirements (complexity, skills needed, dependencies)
  3. Assigns tasks to appropriate agent swarm members
  4. Monitors progress and reassigns if needed

### 2. Email/Transcript Processing
- **Goal**: Convert emails and meeting transcripts into actionable tasks
- **Flow**:
  1. Receive email/transcript content
  2. Extract action items, deadlines, and assignees
  3. Create projects and tasks automatically
  4. Notify relevant team members

## Architecture Components

### Edge Functions (Supabase)
Located in `/supabase/functions/`

1. **ai-agent-api** - Main entry point for all agent operations
2. **task-analyzer** - Analyzes tasks for agent assignment
3. **content-processor** - Processes emails/transcripts into tasks

### Python Agent System
Located in `/agent-integration/python-agents/`

1. **Coordinator Agent** - Orchestrates the swarm
2. **Task Analyzer Agent** - Determines task suitability for automation
3. **Content Parser Agent** - Extracts tasks from unstructured content
4. **Specialized Worker Agents**:
   - Developer Agent (coding tasks)
   - Writer Agent (documentation)
   - Designer Agent (mockups/diagrams)
   - QA Agent (testing)

### Tools (Agent Capabilities)
Agents will have access to these tools:
- `list_tasks` - Get tasks with filters
- `create_task` - Create new tasks
- `update_task` - Update task status/details
- `assign_task` - Assign to users/agents
- `create_project` - Create new projects
- `add_comment` - Add comments to tasks
- `analyze_workload` - Check team capacity

## Security Model

### Authentication Flow
1. Python agents use service role key (stored securely)
2. Edge Functions validate agent requests
3. All operations logged for audit trail
4. Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Data Access
- Agents only access designated organization data
- No direct database access (only through Edge Functions)
- Sensitive data filtered before agent access

## Integration Points

### Non-Breaking Design
- All agent operations are additive (no changes to existing code)
- Edge Functions are isolated from main app
- Agent activities appear as regular user actions
- Fallback to manual if agent fails

### Real-time Updates
- Agent actions trigger same real-time updates
- Users see agent activities in UI
- Can override/cancel agent actions

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Edge Functions
1. Deploy CRUD operation functions
2. Test with curl/Postman
3. Verify no impact on existing app

### Phase 2: Basic Agents
1. Deploy single task analyzer agent
2. Test on non-critical tasks
3. Monitor performance

### Phase 3: Full Swarm
1. Deploy specialized agents
2. Enable email/transcript processing
3. Full production rollout

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- If agents fail, tasks remain manual
- All agent actions are reversible
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- User notification of agent failures

### Rollback Plan
- Edge Functions can be disabled instantly
- Agent access can be revoked via service key
- All changes tracked in activity log

## Success Metrics
- Tasks automated per day
- Time saved per task
- Error rate < 1%
- User satisfaction score
- Agent response time < 5s
